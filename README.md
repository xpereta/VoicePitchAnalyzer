<h1 align="center">Welcome to VoicePitchAnalyzer ðŸ‘‹</h1>


## About

The goal of this project is to provide insights into a voice's pitch range and show analytics based on the (traditional) 'male', 'female' or androgynous pitch ranges. This is an open source project and we're welcoming contributions.

Desired contributions:

- UI Tests
- Further language packs

Please feel free to reach out to [Carola](https://twitter.com/_Caro_N) or [David](https://twitter.com/DavidSeek) if you have ideas for unlisted contributions.
